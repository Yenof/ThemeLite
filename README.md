### <br><b>Do not seek support for this plugin in the RuneLite Discord or RuneLite GitHub.


<br><br>
*When switching RuneLite config profiles, ThemeLite has been known to cause a delay. (do not switch profiles in unsafe areas.)<br>
*ThemeLite requires RuneLite's Custom Chrome for many things, to enable go to: `Config > RuneLite > Enable custom window chrome`.


# Getting Started

_Please be patient while changing ThemeLite settings or switching profiles, it redraws parts of the client window on changes and can take a moment._

<br>

The `Themes` config option contains a few pre-made themes to give you some ideas.
Any other config options apply _after_ Themes, so you can override desired elements.



ThemeLite config options are split into groups based on the part of the interface being changed.
The current groups are:

Themes <br>
Titlebar<br>
Sidebar<br>
Sidepanel<br>

_*Hovering over config options with the cursor will display tooltips with sometimes helpful information._
